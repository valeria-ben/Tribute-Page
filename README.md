# After all, I'm happy with the result!

This was a simple project, but, believe me, it had me fixing a couple of problems.

# Here are some things I learned:

## HTML FILE PATHS 

🔸 I was really having a hard time trying to figure out why didn't the HTML file and CSS file where not connecting. Neither the CSS, images nor fonts where working. It was all about the paths!

I found more info on W3schools, <a src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_filepaths.asp">check it out</a> to learn about it.

## FONTS 

🔸 There are two main formats used:

1. True Type Font (TTF) It was a joint effort between Apple and Microsoft in the late 1980s. They needed a format that could be read by default by most printers.

2. Open True Font (OTF) It was also a joint effort, but between Adobe and Microsoft. This format had extra space, so they could include ligatures, glyphs, small caps, alternate characters and old-style figures.

🔸 How to use them on CSS?

After downloading them into a folder on the project, you can use them with the CSS font-face rule:

@font-face {
    font-family: "font-family-name";
    src: url(...);
}
